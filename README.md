# Estimating epi intervals from transmission pair data

This repo provides a Bayesian model, immplemented in greta, to infer: infectiousness profiles, generation intervals, serial intervals, and incubation period distributions from the dates of infection, symptom onset, and isolation for infector/infectee pairs.

Just run `simulation_estimation.R` to get started.

This requires the latest version of the greta  R package from GitHub: https://github.com/greta-dev/greta
You can find help installing greta on the greta forum: https://forum.greta-stats.org/
